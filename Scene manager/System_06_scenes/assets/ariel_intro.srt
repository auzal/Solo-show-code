1
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:04,289
I think the hardest thing of all

2
00:00:04,314 --> 00:00:05,727
is not being angry.

3
00:00:06,664 --> 00:00:08,016
Throughout time,

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:09,250
we've been lied to,

5
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,107
we've been told half truths

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,247
and information has been hidden from us.

7
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,396
They've made us feel furious, and they've made us feel ashamed.

8
00:00:17,646 --> 00:00:18,779
Despite everything,

9
00:00:19,012 --> 00:00:20,068
we are here,

10
00:00:20,122 --> 00:00:22,426
and we've put ourselves together as best we could.

11
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,645
I believe we've built our identity and our history

12
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,473
through our every day actions.

13
00:00:28,238 --> 00:00:29,809
Generally speaking, we are alone.

14
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:30,730
I mean,

15
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:32,262
it's only us.

16
00:00:32,755 --> 00:00:35,450
We don't know much about those that came before us,

17
00:00:35,482 --> 00:00:39,661
that history is made of scraps that at this point have become shreds.

18
00:00:40,013 --> 00:00:44,036
More than once, we picked up the pieces and tried to make them fit,

19
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:46,404
but it turns out we are alone.

20
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,782
It's difficult for me,

21
00:00:48,828 --> 00:00:52,891
to look away from the systemic violence and the dehumanization.

22
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,758
I also can't overlook the fact

23
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:58,422
that our country's history, with it's coups

24
00:00:58,447 --> 00:01:00,125
and the tireless fucking right,

25
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:02,875
laid down the framework of our history as a family.

26
00:01:05,554 --> 00:01:08,038
I believe that what's important is that despite all the pain,

27
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:09,617
our bond is one of love.

28
00:01:10,429 --> 00:01:13,710
I also believe that having such a peronist mother

29
00:01:13,749 --> 00:01:16,820
it's impossible to foster a bond of anything but love.

30
00:01:17,249 --> 00:01:20,773
I suspect that my mom looked for her family where she could:

31
00:01:20,844 --> 00:01:22,023
in her neighborhood,

32
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:23,187
in the union,

33
00:01:23,224 --> 00:01:25,021
and in our compañerxs.

34
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:28,810
We have fought together against oblivion and time.

35
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:32,724
We have also fought together against whoever we had to.

36
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:37,383
We have screamed and we've thrown stones against some piece of shit's windows.

37
00:01:37,812 --> 00:01:40,391
We have marched under the rain and under the sun,

38
00:01:40,461 --> 00:01:41,578
sometimes alone,

39
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:43,055
sometimes in a sea of compañerxs.

40
00:01:43,644 --> 00:01:47,643
We've spent our lives cursing, kicking and being mad,

41
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:49,089
but together.

42
00:01:50,057 --> 00:01:51,550
Overall, I think

43
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,609
that we're left with what we've done, and not with what's been told to us.

44
00:01:54,634 --> 00:01:56,437
I think about the fact that despite everything,

45
00:01:56,462 --> 00:01:57,711
we are here.
